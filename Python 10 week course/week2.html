These basic concepts are a necessity to build a foundation on which you can learn any programming language. After all, you don’t start building a house from the roof down, you need to have a foundation to work from. That’s where this week comes in to play.</div><div id="Par3" class="Para">The focus this week will be on <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">data types</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">variables</span>. These are core concepts in just about any programming language. The beauty of learning a single language is that it allows you to pick up other languages easily. This is due in part that all languages follow the same core concepts. By the end of this week, you’ll be able to understand how to write simple programs on your own. A program such as the one that we’ll build together, where we will print information out to the user in a nicely formatted receipt.</div><div id="Par4" class="Para">This week I also introduce your first <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">challenge question</span>. These questions are to ensure that you begin to “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">think like a developer</span>.” Some questions may not have definitive answers, but rather they’ll push you to create solutions and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">problem-solve</span>. It’s important that you spend some time thinking about each question, so that you can begin to train your problem-solving skills. After all, it’s the most sought-after skill in every development industry.</div><div id="Par5" class="Para"><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Overview</span><div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><div id="Par6" class="Para">Understanding data types</div></li><li><div id="Par7" class="Para">How to use variables</div></li><li><div id="Par8" class="Para">Seeing what you can do with strings</div></li><li><div id="Par9" class="Para">How to manipulate a string</div></li><li><div id="Par10" class="Para">Coding a program that prints receipts</div></li></ul></div>
</div><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3 ParaTypeOverview"><div class="Heading">Challenge Question</div><div id="Par11" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">In programming, we have a concept called “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">algorithms</span>.” An algorithm is simply just a set of steps. Whether you know it or not, you’ve used algorithms throughout your life. A common algorithm is a recipe that you follow to make food.</div><div id="Par12" class="Para">To think like a developer, you must begin to understand how a computer reads code. A computer is only as smart as the program that it’s supposed to execute. This means that even the smartest computers can fail if the steps aren’t correct. Let’s use a recipe to bake a cake, for instance. If we miss a single step or leave the cake in the oven for too long, then we fail, as would a computer that is missing a crucial step.</div><div id="Par13" class="Para">Now, I’d like you to think about the steps for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Write down your steps on a piece of paper. Try to think like a computer when you write them out and understand that you need to be as precise as possible. The answer will be at the end of this chapter.</div></div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Monday: Comments and Basic Data Types</h2><div id="Par14" class="Para">Today marks your first lesson of the Python language! The two concepts taught today will help build that foundation that we’re striving for. To follow along with the content for today, let’s open up Jupyter Notebook from our “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">python_bootcamp</span>” folder. If needed, go back to last week’s lesson on how to open up Jupyter Notebook. Once it’s open, create a new file, and rename it to “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Week_02</span>.” Next, make the first cell markdown, with the following code:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC1"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># Comments &amp; Basic Data Types</div></div></div></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">What Are Comments and Why Use Them?</h3><div id="Par15" class="Para"><span id="ITerm1">Comments</span> are like notes that you leave behind, either for yourself or someone else to read. They are not read in by the interpreter, meaning that you can write whatever you want, and the computer will ignore it. A good comment will be short, easy to read, and to the point. Putting a comment on every line is tedious, but not putting any comments at all is bad practice. As you program, you’ll begin to understand what that happy medium looks like.</div><div id="Par16" class="Para">When you begin to write larger programs, you’ll want to leave notes for yourself. Too often have I created a program, stopped working on it for three weeks, and when I came back, I forget what I was working on. Leaving comments isn’t only good for yourself but also for others who will read your code. Think of comments as breadcrumbs that help you understand what’s going on.</div></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Writing Comments</h3><div id="Par17" class="Para">In Python, we can write comments using the <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">hash</span> (#) <span id="ITerm2">symbol</span>. Any text that follows this symbol will be commented out. In the cell below our markdown header, let’s write our first comment:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC2"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># this is a comment</div></div></div></div><div id="Par18" class="Para">Let’s go ahead and run the cell. Notice that nothing happens. This is because the computer completely ignores any comments. For the most part, we’ll write comments on their own line; however, in certain instances you may see comments written in line with code. In the same cell as the previous comment, let’s add the following line:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC3"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">print("Hello")       # this is also a comment</div></div></div></div><div id="Par19" class="Para">The first portion of this line will run and output <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“Hello”</span><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">,</span> but the second part will be ignored because of the hash symbol.</div><div id="FPar2" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><div class="Heading">Note</div><div id="Par20" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Markdown uses hash characters for headers, like Python comments. Make sure you know what type your cell is set to <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“markdown/cell.”</span></div></div><div id="Par21" class="Para">To write multiline comments so that you may write more descriptive paragraphs for larger portions of code, we would need to use three opening and closing double quotes:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC4"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">" " "</div><div class="FixedLine">       This is a multi-Line comment</div><div class="FixedLine">" " "</div><div class="FixedLine">print("Hello")       # this is also a comment</div></div></div></div><div id="Par22" class="Para">Go ahead and <span id="ITerm3">run</span> the cell. Notice that the text within the multiline comment gets ignored. These types of comments are great for adding descriptive paragraphs about your code. Be sure not to overuse them, however, as you can certainly make a mess of a program by using too many of them.</div></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">What Are Data Types?</h3><div id="Par23" class="Para">Almost all languages use data types, they are essential to every program. <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Data types</span> are how we define values, likes words or numbers. If I were to ask you what a sentence is made up of, you would probably reply with <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“words or characters</span>.” Well, in programming, we call them strings. Just the same as we refer to numbers as their own data type as well. Data types define what we can do and how these values are stored in memory on the computer. In Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">2-1</a></span>, you’ll find that each row displays a data type, a sample value, and a description for each. Read each section for a longer explanation for each type. You can find the four basic types that we cover this week within the table.<div id="Tab1" class="Table"><div class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 2-1</span><div class="SimplePara">Data type <span id="ITerm4">examples</span></div></div></div><table border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"><col align="left"><col align="left"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Data Types</div></th><th align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Sample Value</div></th><th align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Description</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Integer</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">5</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Whole numbers</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Float</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">5.7</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Decimal numbers</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Boolean</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">True</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">True or False values</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">String</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">“Hello”</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Characters within quotes</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">The Print Statement</h3><div id="Par24" class="Para">Before we go any further, I just want to touch on the <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">print statement</span>. In almost every language, you need the ability to output information to the user; within Python we’re able to do this through the print statement. Now I don’t want to get too far in depth, but the print statement is what we call a <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">function</span> in Python. We will cover functions during the entire fifth week. For now, though, just know that the print statement allows us to output information to the user. The way it works is by writing the keyword “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">print</span>” followed by parenthesis. Whatever is inside of the parenthesis will be output for the user to see.</div></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Integers</h3><div id="Par25" class="Para">These data types are often called <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">integers</span> or <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">ints</span><span id="ITerm5">


</span>. They are positive or negative <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">WHOLE</span> numbers with no decimal point. Integers are used for a variety of reasons, between math calculations and indexing (<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">which we'll get into later</span>); they are a main data type in any language. Let’s go ahead and print a couple examples out in the next cell of our file:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC5"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># the following are all integers</div><div class="FixedLine">print(2)</div><div class="FixedLine">print(10)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par26" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. The resulted output should be a series of numbers <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">2</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">10</span>.</div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Floats</h3><div id="Par27" class="Para">Anytime a number has a decimal point on it, they’re known as floating point data types. It doesn’t matter if it has 1 digit, or 20, it’s still a <span id="ITerm6"><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">float</span>

</span>. The primary use of floats is in math calculations, although they have other uses as well. Let’s check out an example:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC6"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># the following are all floats</div><div class="FixedLine">print(10.953)</div><div class="FixedLine">print(8.0)       # even this number is a float</div></div></div></div><div id="Par28" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. The output should be a series of numbers <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">10.953</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">8.0</span>.</div><div id="FPar3" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><div class="Heading">Note</div><div id="Par29" class="Para">The number “8.0” is considered a float, because it includes a decimal point.</div></div></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Booleans</h3><div id="Par30" class="Para">The <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">boolean</span> data <span id="ITerm7">type</span> is either a True or False value. Think of it like a switch, where it’s either off or on. It can’t be assigned any other value except for True or False. Booleans are a key data type, as they provide several uses. One of the most common is for tracking whether something occurred. For instance, if you took a video game and wanted to know if a player was alive, when the player spawned initially, you would set a boolean to “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">True</span>”. When the player lost all their lives, you would set the boolean to “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">False</span>”. This way you can simply check the boolean to see if the player is alive or not. This makes for a quicker program rather than calculating lives each time. Let’s go ahead and run the following:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC7"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># the following are booleans</div><div class="FixedLine">print(True)</div><div class="FixedLine">print(False)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par31" class="Para">Go ahead and run that cell. The output should be the words <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">True</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">False</span>, respectively.</div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Strings</h3><div id="Par32" class="Para">Also known as “<span id="ITerm8"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">String Literals</span>

</span><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">,</span>” these data types are the most complex of the four that we go over today. The actual definition of a string is<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><div id="Par33" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.</span></div></blockquote></div><div id="Par34" class="Para">To most beginners, that’s just going to sound like a bunch of nonsense, so let’s break it down into something simple that we can understand. Strings are nothing more than a set of <span class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic">characters, symbols, numbers, whitespace, and even empty space between two sets of quotation marks</span>. In Python we can use either single or double quotes to create a string. Most of the time it’s personal preference, unless you want to include quotes within a string (<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">see line 3 in the next block</span>). Whatever is wrapped inside of the quotation marks will be considered a string, even if it’s a number. Let’s go ahead and write some examples in the next cell for strings:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC8"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># the following are strings</div><div class="FixedLine">print(" ")</div><div class="FixedLine">print("There's a snake in my boot!")</div><div class="FixedLine">print('True')</div></div></div></div><div id="Par35" class="Para">The output will include an empty line at the top, as we print out nothing in the first statement.</div><div id="FPar4" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3 ParaTypeOverview"><div class="Heading">Monday Exercises</div><div id="Par36" class="Para">
<div class="OrderedList"><ol><li class="ListItem"><span class="ItemNumber">1.</span><div class="ItemContent"><div><div id="Par37" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Output</span>: Print out your name.</div></div></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><span class="ItemNumber">2.</span><div class="ItemContent"><div><div id="Par38" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Type Checking</span>: Try checking the type of a value by using the type() method. This will always print out what kind of data type you’re checking. This is useful to check data types when you’re unsure. As an example:</div><div id="Par39" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic"><span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional">&gt;&gt;&gt; type(int) # will output &lt;class 'int'&gt;</span></span></div></div></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li></ol></div>
</div></div><div id="Par40" class="Para ParaTypeImportant">Today, we focused on the four essential data types in Python. Understanding the difference between each is key as we move forward. In tomorrow’s lesson, we will begin to understand how to save these data types to be used later in the program.</div></div></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Tuesday: Variables</h2><div id="Par41" class="Para"><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Variables</span> are one of the most important beginner-level concepts in programming. They allow us to save values into memory using a name that we assign. This lets us use those values later in the program. Yesterday’s lesson covered different data types, but what if you wanted to save one of those data types to use later? This works like how we store information in our brain, variables are stored in computer memory, and we can access them later by referencing the name we used. I won’t go into the theory behind how Python stores information, as we’re focusing more on the application of programming, but it’s worth noting that Python automatically handles memory storage and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">garbage collection</span> for us.</div><div id="Par42" class="Para">To follow along with this lesson, let’s continue from our previous notebook file “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Week_02</span>” and simply add a markdown cell at the bottom that says “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Variables.</span>”</div><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">How They Work</h3><div id="Par43" class="Para">We declare a name on the left side of the <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">equals operator</span> (“<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">=</span>”), and on the right side, we assign the value that we want to save to use later. Take the following example (<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">no need to write this</span>):<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC9"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">&gt;&gt;&gt; first_name = "John"</span></div></div></div></div><div id="Par44" class="Para">When you create a variable, the line where you assign the value is a step called <span id="ITerm9"><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">declaration</span>

</span>. We’ve just declared a variable with a name of “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">first_name</span>” and assigned it the value of the string data type “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">John</span>”. This string is now stored in memory, and we’re able to access it by calling the variable name “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">first_name</span>”.</div><div id="FPar5" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><div class="Heading">Note</div><div id="Par45" class="Para">Variable names can contain only letters, underscores, and numbers; however, they cannot start with a number.</div></div></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Handling Naming Errors</h3><div id="Par46" class="Para">All programmers make mistakes, so it’s not a problem if you run into <span id="ITerm10">errors</span>. It just comes with the job. Let’s look at a common mistake that occurs with variables (<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">no need to write this</span>):<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC10"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">&gt;&gt;&gt; Sport = 'baseball'    # capital 'S'</span></div><div class="FixedLine"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sport)          # lowercase 'S'</span></div></div></div></div><div id="Par47" class="Para">If we try to run this code, we’ll get the following error/output:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC11"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NameError: name 'sport' is not defined</span></div></div></div></div><div id="Par48" class="Para">This is because the names are completely different. We referenced a variable with a lowercase “s” but declared one with capital “S.” To fix this we would capitalize the “s” in sport within print.</div></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Integer and Float Variables</h3><div id="Par49" class="Para">To store an integer or <span id="ITerm11">float</span> in a variable, we give a name to the left of the operator and write a number on the right side. In the next cell, let’s go ahead and write the following code:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC12"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">num1 = 5           # storing an integer into a variable</div><div class="FixedLine">num2 = 8.4         # storing a float into a variable</div><div class="FixedLine">print(num1, num2)  # you can print multiple items using commas</div></div></div></div><div id="Par50" class="Para">Go ahead and run that cell. Notice the output is <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">5 and 8.4</span>, even though we print out “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">num1</span>” and “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">num2.</span>” We’re printing out the value that is stored in those variables.</div></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Boolean Variables</h3><div id="Par51" class="Para">Remember that <span id="ITerm12">booleans</span> are <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">True</span> or <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">False</span> values, so storing them is as simple as typing in one of those two words. Let’s write the following:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC13"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># storing a boolean into a variable</div><div class="FixedLine">switch = True</div><div class="FixedLine">print(switch)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par52" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Go ahead and run that cell. The resulted output is “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">True</span>”. Notice that in Jupyter Notebook, the value of True or False will glow green. This is a good indication if we wrote it correctly.</div></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">String Variables</h3><div id="Par53" class="Para"><span id="ITerm13">Strings</span> are as easy to store as the previous three data types. Just keep in mind that the use of single or double quotes matters. Let’s go ahead and write the following code in a new cell:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC14"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># storing strings into a variable</div><div class="FixedLine">name = 'John Smith'</div><div class="FixedLine">fav_number = '9'</div><div class="FixedLine">print(name, fav_number)            # will print 9 next to the name</div></div></div></div><div id="Par54" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Go ahead and run that. Remember that the string “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">9</span>” is not the same as the integer 9. These two data types act differently, even though the output looks similar.</div></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Using Multiple Variables</h3><div id="Par55" class="Para">In almost any program you’ll write, you’re going to need to perform some calculations or <span id="ITerm14">manipulation</span> on variables. In the following code, we access the values from previously declared variables and add them together to create a sum. Make sure that the previous cells have been run before running this cell. Let’s go ahead and put this in a new cell:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC15"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># using two variables to create another variable</div><div class="FixedLine">result = num1 + num2</div><div class="FixedLine">print(result)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par56" class="Para">After running this cell, you’ll notice that it added <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">5</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">8.4</span> together to output <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">13.4</span>.</div><div id="FPar6" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><div class="Heading">Note</div><div id="Par57" class="Para">If you get an error saying that a variable doesn’t exist, try running the cell where that variable is declared first.</div></div></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Using Operators on Numerical Variables</h3><div id="Par58" class="Para">Think of Python as a calculator, where we can alter any <span id="ITerm15">variables</span> we want. In the following code, we alter the “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">result</span>” variable defined previously:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC16"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># adding, deleting, multiplying, dividing from a variable</div><div class="FixedLine">result += 1   # same as saying result = result + 1</div><div class="FixedLine">print(result)</div><div class="FixedLine">result *= num1   # same as saying result = result * num1</div><div class="FixedLine">print(result)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par59" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. In the first line, we added 1 to the result, then later we multiplied it by the value of “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">num1,</span>” which is 5. All the while, the computer saved the result variable so we could continue to edit it. Then we print the result, which comes out to <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">72.0</span>.</div></div><div id="Sec18" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Overwriting Previously Created Variables</h3><div id="Par60" class="Para">Python makes it easy for us to change the value of a <span id="ITerm16">variable</span>, by simply re-declaring it. In some languages you would have to define the data type, but Python handles all of that for us. We’ve seen this occur with the preceding result variable, but it’s worth noting in its own cell:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC17"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># defining a variable and overwriting it's value</div><div class="FixedLine">name = 'John'</div><div class="FixedLine">print(name)</div><div class="FixedLine">name = 'Sam'</div><div class="FixedLine">print(name)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par61" class="Para">Go ahead and run that in a new cell. You’ll notice that the output shows <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“John”</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“Sam”</span>. The location of when you access or re-declare your variables matter; keep that in mind.</div></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Whitespace</h3><div id="Par62" class="Para">Whitespace just means characters which are used for spacing and have an “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">empty</span>” representation. In the context of python, it means tabs and spaces.

The next two days cover <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">working with</span> and <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">manipulating</span> strings so that we may build a receipt printing program at the end of the week. We won’t worry about taking in user input but rather how to format strings, what a string index is, etc.</div><div id="Par70" class="Para">To follow along with this lesson, let’s continue from our previous notebook file “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Week_02</span>” and simply add a markdown cell at the bottom that says, “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Working with Strings.</span>”</div><div id="Sec21" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">String Concatenation</h3><div id="Par71" class="Para">When we talk about <span id="ITerm18">concatenating</span> strings, I mean that we want to add one string to the end of another. This concept is just one of many ways to add string variables together to complete a larger string. For the first example, let’s add three separate strings together:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC20"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># using the addition operator without variables</div><div class="FixedLine">name = "John" + " " + "Smith"</div><div class="FixedLine">print(name)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par72" class="Para">Go ahead and run that cell below the markdown <span id="ITerm19">cell</span>. The output we get is “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">John Smith</span>”. We ended up adding two strings that were names and separated them with the use of a string with a space inside. Let’s go ahead and try to store the two names into variables first:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC21"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># using the addition operator with variables</div><div class="FixedLine">first_name = "John"</div><div class="FixedLine">last_name = "Smith"</div><div class="FixedLine">full_name = first_name + " " + last_name</div><div class="FixedLine">print(full_name)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par73" class="Para">Go ahead and run that cell. We get the exact same output as the previous cell; however, we used variables to store the information this time.</div></div><div id="Sec22" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Formatting Strings</h3><div id="Par74" class="Para">Earlier we created a full name by adding multiple strings together to create a larger string. While this is perfectly fine to use, for larger strings it becomes tough to read. Imagine that you had to create a sentence that used 10 variables. Appending all ten variables into a sentence is tough to keep track of, not to mention read. We’ll need to use a concept called string formatting. This will allow us to write an entire string and inject the variables we want to use in the proper locations.</div><div id="Sec23" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">.format( )</h4><div id="Par75" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm20">format method</span><span id="ITerm21">


</span> works by putting a period directly after the ending string quotation, followed by the keyword “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">format</span>”. Within the parenthesis after the keyword are the variables that will be injected into the string. No matter what data type it is, it will insert it into the string in the proper location, which brings up the question, how does it know where to put it? That’s where the curly brackets come in to play. The order of the curly brackets is the same order for the variables within the format <span id="ITerm22">parenthesis</span>. To include multiple variables in one format string, you simply separate each by a comma. Let’s check out some examples:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC22"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># injecting variables using the format method</div><div class="FixedLine">name = "John"</div><div class="FixedLine">print( "Hello { }".format(name) )</div><div class="FixedLine">print( "Hello { }, you are { } years old!".format(name, 28) )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par76" class="Para">Go ahead and run that cell. We’ll see that the output in the first line is “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Hello John</span>” and the second “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Hello John, you are 28 years old</span>”. Keep in mind that the format function will inject variables and even data types themselves. In this instance, we injected the integer value 28.</div></div><div id="Sec24" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">f Strings (New in Python 3.6)</h4><div id="Par77" class="Para">The new way to inject variables into a string in Python is by using what we call <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">f strings</span><span id="ITerm23">


</span>. By putting the letter “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">f</span>” in front of a string, you’re able to inject a variable into a string directly in line. This is important, as it makes the string easier to read when it gets longer, making this the preferred method to format a string. Just keep in mind you need Python 3.6 to use this; otherwise you’ll receive an error. To inject a variable in a string, simply wrap curly brackets around the name of the variable. Let’s look at an example:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC23"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># using the new f strings</div><div class="FixedLine">name = "John"</div><div class="FixedLine">print( f"Hello {name}" )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par78" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Go ahead and run the cell. We get the same output that we had gotten with the <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">.format()</span> method; however, it’s much easier to read the code this time.</div><div id="FPar8" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><div class="Heading">Note</div><div id="Par79" class="Para">Throughout this book, we’ll be using the .format() method.</div></div></div><div id="Sec25" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Formatting in Python 2</h4><div id="Par80" class="Para">Python 2 doesn’t include the .format() <span id="ITerm24">method</span>; instead you would use <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">percent operators</span> to mark the location of the variable being injected. The following is an example to inject the variable “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">name</span>” into the location of “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">%s</span>”. The letter after the percent operator signifies the data type. For integers, you would use “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">%d</span>” for digit. After the string closes, you would place a percent operator, followed by the variables you would like to use. Let’s look at an example:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC24"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># one major difference between versions 2 &amp; 3</div><div class="FixedLine">name = 'John'</div><div class="FixedLine">print('Hello, %s' % name)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par81" class="Para">Go ahead and run that cell. You’ll notice that we get the same output as the previous methods. If you wanted to format a string in Python 2 with multiple variables, then you would need to write the following:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC25"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># python 2 multiple variable formatting</div><div class="FixedLine">first_name = "John"</div><div class="FixedLine">last_name = "Smith"</div><div class="FixedLine">print( "Hello, %s %s" % (first_name, last_name) )        # surround the variables in parenthesis</div></div></div></div><div id="Par82" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. We’ll get the output “Hello, John Smith”. When passing multiple variables, you need to surround the variable names within parenthesis and separate each by a comma. Notice there are also two symbols within the string that represent the location of each respective variable in order from left to right.</div></div></div><div id="Sec26" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">String Index</h3><div id="Par83" class="Para">One other key concept that we need to understand about strings is how they are stored. When a computer saves a string into memory, each character within the string is assigned what we call an “<span class="EmphasisTypeBold">index</span><span id="ITerm25">


</span><span class="EmphasisTypeBold">.</span>” An index is essentially a location in memory. Think of an index as a position in a line that you’re waiting in at the mall. If you were at the front of the line, you would be given an index number of zero. The person behind you would be given index position one. The person behind them would be given index position two and so on.</div><div id="FPar9" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><div class="Heading">Note</div><div id="Par84" class="Para">Indexing in most languages, including Python, starts at 0 not 1.</div></div><div id="Par85" class="Para">The same is true for Python strings. If we take a string like <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Hello”</span> and break down their indexes (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">2-1</a></span>), we can see that the letter “<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">H</span>” is located at index zero. Let’s try an example:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC26"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"># using indexes to print each element</div><div class="FixedLine">word = "Hello"</div><div class="FixedLine">print( word[ 0 ] )            # will output 'H'</div><div class="FixedLine">print( word[ 1 ] )            # will output 'e'</div><div class="FixedLine">print( word[ -1 ] )           # will output 'o'</div></div></div></div><div id="Par86" class="Para">In order to index a specific element, you use square brackets to the right of the variable name. Within those <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">square brackets</span>, you put the index location you wish to <span id="ITerm26">access</span>. In the preceding case, we’re accessing the first two elements in the string <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“Hello”</span> stored in the variable <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“word”</span>. The last line accesses the element in the last position. Using negative index numbers will result in trying to access information from the back, such that -4 would result in the output of the letter “e”.<div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img src="/library/view/python-projects-for/9781484253557/A481544_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="A481544_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:8.12em" width="945" height="325"></div><div class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-1</span><div class="SimplePara">Index locations for a string</div></div></div></div></div><div id="Par87" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Be very careful when working with indexes. An index is a specific location in memory. If you try to access a location that is out of range, you will crash your program because it’s trying to access a place in memory that does not exist. For example, if we tried to access index 5 on the <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Hello</span>”.</div></div><div id="Sec27" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">String Slicing</h3><div id="Par88" class="Para">I want to just quickly introduce the topic of <span id="ITerm27">slicing</span>. Slicing is used mostly with Python lists; however, you can use it on strings as well. Slicing is essentially when you only want a piece of the variable, such that if I only wanted “He” from the word “Hello”, we would write the following:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC27"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">print( word[ 0 : 2 ] )            # will output 'He'</div></div></div></div><div id="Par89" class="Para">The first number in the bracket is the starting index; the second is the stopping index. We will touch on this concept in a later week; however, feel free to mess around with slicing. Before the day ends though, I’d like to quickly cover the start, stop, and step arguments when slicing. The syntax for slicing is always<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC28"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine"><span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">&gt;&gt;&gt; variable_name[ start : stop : step ]</span></div></div></div></div><div id="Par90" class="Para">In the previous cell, we only included the start and stop because the step is optional and defaults to incrementing by one each time. However, what if we wanted to print every other letter:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC29"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">print( word[ 0 : 5 : 2 ] )         # will output 'Hlo'</div></div></div></div><div id="Par91" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. By passing the step as the number two, it increments the index by two each time instead of one.

I’ve provided line numbers in case you follow along on a single cell:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC37"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">6| # create a company name and information</div><div class="FixedLine">7| company_name = "coding temple, inc."</div><div class="FixedLine">8| company_address = "283 Franklin St."</div><div class="FixedLine">9| company_city = "Boston, MA"</div></div></div></div><div id="Par126" class="Para">As an example, we’ve left the company name all lowercase so that we can use a string manipulation method to fix this issue.</div><div id="Par127" class="Para">Lastly, let’s declare the message that we’ll output to the user at the bottom of the receipt:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC38"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">11| # declare ending message</div><div class="FixedLine">12| message = "Thanks for shopping with us today!"</div></div></div></div><div id="Par128" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. Now that we’ve defined all our variables, we can move on.</div></div><div id="Sec38" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Creating the Top Border</h3><div id="Par129" class="Para">As we can see from the design that we’ve laid out at the beginning of this project, we’ll need to print out a <span id="ITerm40">border</span> on the top and bottom. Let’s start with the top border:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC39"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">14| # create a top border</div><div class="FixedLine">15| print( "*" * 50 )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par130" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Go ahead and run the cell. There’s a new concept being applied here, where we write <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“*” * 50</span>. All we’re trying to do is print out 50 stars in a row for a top border, and rather than making 50 print statements, we can simply multiply the string by the number we want. This way we get our top border while keeping our code slim and easy to read. Readability of code is always key.</div></div><div id="Sec39" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Displaying the Company Info</h3><div id="Par131" class="Para">We’ve already defined our variables for the <span id="ITerm41">company</span> in the preceding lines, so let’s display them:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC40"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">17| # print company information first, using format</div><div class="FixedLine">18| print( "\t\t{ }".format( company_name.title( ) )</div><div class="FixedLine">19| print( "\t\t{ }".format(company_address) )</div><div class="FixedLine">20| print( "\t\t{ }".format(company_city) )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par132" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. These print statements may seem a little hard to understand at first; however, I’m introducing an escape character to you. Escape characters are read in by the defining backslash <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“\”</span> character. Whatever comes after that backslash is what the computer will interpret. In the three print statements, we use <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“\t”</span> for a tab indentation. Another popular escape character you may see is <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">“\n”</span> which means newline and acts as if you hit the enter key. We use two escaping characters in a row to center it within our output. Let’s create a divider:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC41"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">22| # print a line between sections</div><div class="FixedLine">23| print( "=" * 50 )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par133" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. Like how we printed out our top border, we’ll multiply the equal symbol by 50 to create the same width line. This will give the appearance of separate sections.</div></div><div id="Sec40" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Displaying the Product Info</h3><div id="Par134" class="Para">Looking at our original design, we want to create a header <span id="ITerm42">before</span> we list out each product’s name and price. This can be done simply by using our escaping characters for indenting:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC42"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">25| # print out header for section of items</div><div class="FixedLine">26| print("\tProduct Name\tProduct Price")</div></div></div></div><div id="Par135" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. Due to the size of the header names, we only need to use a single tab before each header. Now we can go ahead and output a row for each products’ information:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC43"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">28| # create a print statement for each product</div><div class="FixedLine">29| print( "\t{ }\t\t${ }".format(p1_name.title( ), p1_price) )</div><div class="FixedLine">30| print( "\t{ }\t\t${ }".format(p2_name.title( ), p2_price) )</div><div class="FixedLine">31| print( "\t{ }\t\t${ }".format(p3_name.title( ), p3_price) )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par136" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. We’re using similar styles as the previous print statements in order to center each product’s title and price under their respective headers. Try not to get too confused by all the symbols within the print string; you can simply break them down to a tab, followed by the first variable being formatted into the string, followed by two tabs, followed by a dollar sign (<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">in order to make the price look like currency</span>), and followed by the second variable being formatted into the string. This completes the section for our items, so let’s put in another section divider:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC44"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">33| # print a line between sections</div><div class="FixedLine">34| print('=' * 50)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par137" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. This will set us up for our next section to display the total.</div></div><div id="Sec41" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Displaying the Total</h3><div id="Par138" class="Para">Like the products section, we want to create a header for our total, but we want to also center it underneath the price <span id="ITerm43">column</span> of the products section. To do so, we’ll use three tabs:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC45"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">36| # print out header for section of total</div><div class="FixedLine">37| print("\t\t\tTotal")</div></div></div></div><div id="Par139" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. Now that we have our total header aligned with the price column in products, we can output our total on the next line. Before we can print out a total, however, we must first calculate the total, which is the sum of all our products. Let’s define a variable called total and then print it out:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC46"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">39| # calculate total price and print out</div><div class="FixedLine">40| total = p1_price + p2_price + p3_price</div><div class="FixedLine">41| print( "\t\t\t${ }".format(total) )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par140" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. Again, we’ve gone ahead and added three tabs, plus a dollar sign to make the total value appear as currency. Let’s now add a section border:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC47"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">43| # print a line between sections</div><div class="FixedLine">44| print( "=" * 50)</div></div></div></div><div id="Par141" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell to make sure it looks like the desired output so far.</div></div><div id="Sec42" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Displaying the Ending Message</h3><div id="Par142" class="Para">To display the final thank you <span id="ITerm44">message</span>, our design has it spaced out slightly more than any other section, so we’ll need to add a couple of newlines to give it some extra spacing:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC48"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">46| # output thank you message</div><div class="FixedLine">47| print( "\n\t{ }\n".format(message) )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par143" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell. Our message is now centered, and we’re ready to move on.</div></div><div id="Sec43" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Displaying the Bottom Border</h3><div id="Par144" class="Para">To finish off this simple printing program, we need to throw in a <span id="ITerm45">bottom border</span> for aesthetics:<div class="ProgramCode" id="PC49"><div class="LineGroup"><div class="FixedLine">49| # create a bottom border</div><div class="FixedLine">50| print( "*" * 50 )</div></div></div></div><div id="Par145" class="Para">Go ahead and run the cell one last time.</div><div id="Par146" class="Para ParaTypeImportant">Congratulations! As simple as it may be, it’s a huge milestone. After learning more material, try coming back here to improve it.</div></div></div><div id="Sec44" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Weekly Summary</h2><div id="Par147" class="Para">This week we went over some very important foundational concepts in programming with variables and working with strings. You must always keep in mind that variables need to be declared before you can use them and that the name associated is saved in memory with the value on the right side of the equals operator. Strings are easy to work with in Python, as the language has a variety of methods that we can call in order to do the work for us. At the end of the week, we were able to build a simple receipt printing program. Try breaking the program! I always encourage students to try and break programs because it will teach you how to fix it.</div></div><div id="Sec45" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Challenge Question Solution</h2><div id="Par148" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">There isn’t a definitive solution to making a PB&amp;J sandwich, but I want you to go back and see if you weren’t specific enough. <span class="EmphasisTypeBold">Computers are only as smart as we program them to be</span>, so if you said to put the peanut butter on the bread, it may just interpret it as putting the entire jar on the bread instead.
